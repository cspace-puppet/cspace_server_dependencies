server_dependencies
===================

A puppet module for managing the dependencies required by a CollectionSpace
server instance.

**Please make changes on the appropriate branch for the CollectionSpace
version to be installed**: e.g. `v4.2`, `v4.1`. And create new branches
for new CollectionSpace versions. (The `master` branch is now deprecated.)
